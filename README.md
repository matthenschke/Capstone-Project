# Capstone Project

My aim of my Capstone Project is to demonstrate the workings of IoT using an online open-source platform known as [ThingsBoard](http://demo.thingsboard.io/home). With ThingsBoard, you can upload telemetry collected from your devices and also create dashboards to visualize the data. The telemetry could be anything from temperature, humdidity, pressure, etc... The protocol that was used for the connection between your devices and ThingsBoard is known as [MQTT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MQTT). This repo contains sample code where temperature data collected from four Zigbee sensor nodes were pushed to ThingsBoard where as you can see below, can be visualized using its custom dashboard widgets such as digital gauges and thermometers. 

I have submitted a paper based on this work, co-authored by my two professors that is now published on [IEEE](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9114929).
